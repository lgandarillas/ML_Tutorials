# ML_Tutorials

This repository contains my notes for the [Machine Learning](https://aplicaciones.uc3m.es/cpa/generaFicha?est=218&anio=2024&plan=489&asig=15757&idioma=2) course at [UC3M](https://www.uc3m.es/home). It includes tutorials, code snippets, and resources to facilitate learning and implementation of various ML concepts.

#### Setting Up the Environment
To ensure a clean and isolated Python environment, it is recommended to use a virtual environment (`venv`). Follow these steps:
1. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
2. Activate the virtual environment
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
