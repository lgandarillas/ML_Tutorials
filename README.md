# ML_Tutorials

This repository contains my notes for the Machine Learning course at UC3M. It includes tutorials, code snippets, and resources to facilitate learning and implementation of various ML concepts.

#### Setting Up the Environment
To ensure a clean and isolated Python environment, it is recommended to use a virtual environment (`venv`). Follow these steps:
1. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
2. Activate the virtual environment
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
